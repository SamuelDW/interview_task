INTRODUCTION:

This folder contains how most of this code would be written if using a Symfony framework
however, due to time constraints, I was unable to get this running on the local Symfony web server.
This is believed to have been caused by a combination of utlising Symfony 5.0 in combination 
with PHP 8.0.1
